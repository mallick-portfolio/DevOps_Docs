## Getting started

### What is Docker?

In simple word Docker is a container technology or A tool for creating and managing containers

### Why Dockers?
If you understand why docker need then we will get the overview of docker.

Suppose you are running a node base software with the version 20.02. Your software has multiple dependencies all are working fine
in your local system. Now you want to share your software with your friend who also want to run your software in his own machine. 
But your friend local machine has node js version 18.04. He tried to install all the dependencis for this project but he is getting error. Because all the dependencis are not supported in node js verison 18.04. So you told him to install node version 20.02. 

In this case every time you need to setup same enviroment to run your software. But if you find anything that will help you to solve this issue like you will give all your code and dependencis and anyone can run your project without setup the same environment then that tool is Docker as well as other tools also available.

### How Docker solve this above problem
